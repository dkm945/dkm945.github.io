            <p>I am an aspiring web developer with a lifelong love of technology. Somehow I never thought to try and make a livelihood from it until after I got a Master's degree in music. The first time I finagled with computers was in the mid-90's. I spent an inordinate amount of time looking through the Warcraft II CD and its section in Program Files (or whatever it was called at the time) to see what I could open, and I remember opening some MIDI files in the audio player. However, I ended up messing up some of the file associations somehow and couldn't fix it. I left it alone since it didn't affect the game and no one else in the family would notice. <br><br>When I'm not studying programming my fondness for technology extends to video games and finagling elsewhere. With respect to gaming, I usually play Destiny 2 with my clanmates in pursuit of "Optimal DPS." Additionally, I help improve and configure our clan's Discord server with the help of Charlemagne and Carl-bot.</p>
