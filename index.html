                <h3><a href="https://dkm945.github.io/Music-website">Music Website</a></h3>
                <p>This was my first project. The purpose was to create a basic, responsive profile site for a professional musician (me, at the time). <a href="https://github.com/dkm945/Music-website">GitHub Repo</a></p>

                <h3><a href="https://dkm945.github.io/Music-website-v2">Music Website, Revised</a></h3>
                <p>Remake of Music Website. I incorporated newer things I learned, and addressed a few challenges a friend made. <a href="https://github.com/dkm945/Music-website-v2">GitHub Repo</a></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML: tables and forms (no backend function), built-in video and audio (w/Mediaelement.js), SVG sprite map</li>
                    <li>CSS: Incorporation of normalize.css, complementary color use (via <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/">Adobe color wheel)</a>, formatting without floats [didn't quite get that header cleaned up], em and % instead of px, non-default font</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><a href="https://dkm945.github.io/Layout-Methods-Project">Layout Methods Project</a></h3>
                <p>Having fallen off the wagon for a long time, I made yet another basic website but this time attempting to make the same page with different layouts: columns with block and inline-block, columns with floats, and flexbox. <a href="https://github.com/dkm945/Layout-Methods-Project">GitHub Repo</a></p>

                <h3><a href="https://dkm945.github.io/Random-Color-Buttons">Random Color Buttons</a></h3>
                <p>One of the Team Treehouse courses had a lesson in which a button assigns a color based on form input. I took it and added buttons that assign color based on randomly generated rgb and hexadecimal values. <a href="https://github.com/dkm945/Random-Color-Buttons">GitHub Repo</a></p>

                <h3><a href="https://dkm945.github.io/Headline-Generator">Headline Generator</a></h3>
                <p>My first JavaScript project from scratch. The goal was to create a clickbait headline text output. I wanted a user to be able to select an optional exclamatory prefix from an options menu, combine that with two form inputs, and have the results printed in one of three randomly selected headline templates. <a href="https://github.com/dkm945/Headline-Generator">GitHub Repo</a></p>

                <h3><a href="https://dkm945.github.io/Headline-Generator-2">Headline Generator 2</a></h3>
                <p>Another project remake but this time using jQuery syntax when possible. I also took this opportunity to practice usage of CSS attribute selectors, pseudo-class selectors, and combinators. I learned it's better to start a jQuery project from scratch than to translate syntax. <a href="https://github.com/dkm945/Headline-Generator-2">GitHub Repo</a></p>
